My realization of c++ string class.
Realization include:
- work with char arrays
- concatenation of string class objects (i.e "+" operator)
- test for equal objects ("==" operator + "!=" operator)
- filling constructor (for example, on input: symbol and integer number; in output: symbol repeated repeated as 
many times, as said number)
- and more upon the way
